The workshop will begin with an introduction to basic concepts in genomics and associated resources, then to protein resources, their uses and limitations, and validation of both experimentally and predicted protein structures.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Finally, the workshop will cover variant effect prediction and offer participants hands-on group projects to bring together the previous daysâ€™ training with highly-experienced mentors. During this time, participants will work with simulated datasets to answer small research questions, then present findings thereafter. Participants will also get the chance to network with one another, trainers, and workshop organisers.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n",
