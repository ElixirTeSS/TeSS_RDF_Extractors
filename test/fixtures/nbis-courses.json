    "description": "One of the key principles of proper scientific procedure is the act of repeating an experiment or analysis and being able to reach similar conclusions. Published research based on computational analysis, e.g. bioinformatics or computational biology, have often suffered from incomplete method descriptions (e.g. list of used software versions); unavailable raw data; and incomplete, undocumented and/or unavailable code. This essentially prevents any possibility of attempting to reproduce the results of such studies. The term “reproducible research” has been used to describe the idea that a scientific publication based on computational analysis should be distributed along with all the raw data and metadata used in the study, all the code and/or computational notebooks needed to produce results from the raw data, and the computational environment or a complete description thereof. Reproducible research not only leads to proper scientific conduct but also provides other researchers the access to build upon previous work. Most importantly, the person setting up a reproducible research project will quickly realize the immediate personal benefits: an organized and structured way of working.

    "description": "One of the key principles of proper scientific procedure is the act of repeating an experiment or analysis and being able to reach similar conclusions. Published research based on computational analysis, e.g. bioinformatics or computational biology, have often suffered from incomplete method descriptions (e.g. list of used software versions); unavailable raw data; and incomplete, undocumented and/or unavailable code. This essentially prevents any possibility of attempting to reproduce the results of such studies. The term “reproducible research” has been used to describe the idea that a scientific publication based on computational analysis should be distributed along with all the raw data and metadata used in the study, all the code and/or computational notebooks needed to produce results from the raw data, and the computational environment or a complete description thereof. Reproducible research not only leads to proper scientific conduct but also provides other researchers the access to build upon previous work. Most importantly, the person setting up a reproducible research project will quickly realize the immediate personal benefits: an organized and structured way of working. The person that most often has to reproduce your own analysis is your future self!",

Workflow management systems such as Snakemake can be used to set up, perform and monitor defined sequences of computational tasks (“workflows”), thereby making data analyses reproducible and scalable. Snakemake was developed in the bioinformatics community and has some features that make it particularly well suited for bioinformatics workflows. The NBIS Tools for reproducible research course is held twice a year and provides an introduction into Snakemake and a tutorial to learn how to use Snakemake. This Snakemake BYOC (bring-your-own-code) workshop provides a follow-up to that introduction. Here, participants will get support from experienced bioinformaticians to A) convert their data analysis from a programming language such as bash, R or python into a Snakemake workflow, or B) apply more advanced techniques to their existing Snakemake workflows.",
