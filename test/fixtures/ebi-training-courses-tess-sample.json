It will also highlight key resources, approaches and methodologies to begin the biological interpretation and analysis of transcriptomics data. Topics will be delivered using a mixture of lectures, practical sessions and open discussions. Practical work during the course will use small, example data-sets - there will be no opportunity to &nbsp;analyse personal data.</p>\r\n",

It features taught and practical sessions that cover how to interpret gene expression data and learn more about the&nbsp;biological significance of certain results.\r\n\r\nParticipants will require a basic knowledge of the Unix command line, the Ubuntu 18 operating system and the R statistical packages. We recommend these free tutorials:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\tBasic introduction to the Unix environment: &nbsp;www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix\r\n\tIntroduction and exercises for Linux: &nbsp;https://training.linuxfoundation.org/free-linux-training \r\n\tBasic R concept tutorials:  www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction\r\n\r\n\r\nRegardless of your current knowledge we encourage successful participants to use these, and other materials, to prepare for attending the course and future work in this area.\r\n",
